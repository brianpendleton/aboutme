#aboutme

I consider myself a __problem solver__. I love working with technology and I enjoy solving challenging problems. I'm comfortable in autonomous environments, but I enjoy collaboration with other engineers.  I often find myself migrating into leadership roles because I have excellent __communication__ skills and I enjoy empowering engineers to reach their full potential.  Communicating technical topics to engineers and non-technical people in the same audience is a challenge I enjoy tackling. 

I love writing code and everything that comes with it: prototyping, designing, testing, debugging, hotfixes, refactoring, commenting, code reviews.  I firmly believe that idiomatic code is important because style and readability are equally as important as performance and testability. Experience has taught me that code needs to be elegant, robust, and simple.  Maintenance and cross-training are easy when engineers without domain knowledge can understand the code.

## Frequently Asked Questions

__Q__: Why is your github account basically empty?

__A__: My career has been writing code which involves a tremendous amount of intellectual property.  That said, I'm shaping the culture where I work to realize the benefits of contributing pieces of our frameworks to the open source community.  I would love to come home and code at night and the weekends, but I'm a family man with my wife and three kids (who I'll teach to code).  Rather than programming, I've incorporated engineering activities with them like [robot turtles](http://www.robotturtles.com/) and [snap circuits](http://www.snapcircuits.net/)

__Q__: Languages of choice?

__A__: I am currently paid to work in Python.  It is a great language to get things done, also a great language for non-CS researchers to learn.  Python sometimes causes headaches without the type safety, especially for a $20billion hedge fund. I've gone so far as to look into type decorators like [contracts](https://github.com/AndreaCensi/contracts), but rather than build a type system into Python we just cover our code in tests. Other languages I've used professionally have been Scala and C#.  I'd love to work in Haskell, but I've only done that in my spare time.  I have done loads of javascript in the past, but I've been out of that for many years and would need a few weeks to get back up to speed.

__Q__: How can I get in touch with you?

__A__: Hit me up through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianpendleton).
